Device Adaptors
---------------

MSActivator comes with several pre-built device adaptors,
providing all the necessary functionality for lifecycle management,
from provisioning to image and asset management.

Adaptors provide the necessary interface to communicate with different devices.

Details on how to get started with device adaptors is available
in the [wiki](https://github.com/openmsa/Device-Adaptors/wiki).

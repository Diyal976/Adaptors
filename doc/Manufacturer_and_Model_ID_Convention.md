Manufacturer and Model ID Convention
====================================


If you need to create a new manufacturer or new model ID,
you must follow the following convention:

YYMMDDNN:

-YY last 2 digits of the year : e.g. 16 for 2016

-MM months e.g. 05 for May

-DD day of the month

-NN number in case you need to develop more than one adaptor on the same day.
